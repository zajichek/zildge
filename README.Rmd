This is a development package that contains a collection of R functions that I am testing and/or frequently use in my day-to-day work. Over time, functionality within here may migrate into stand-alone packages if it makes sense. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of zildge from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zajichek/zildge")
```
